# Pre-Boot Script for B-12 Application

This repository contains a script that prepares the environment and automatically runs the main application. The pre-boot script will ensure that all necessary components are in place before launching the main application.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x** (for running the Python scripts):
   - You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Ollama** (for AI model integration):
   - This application uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for AI models. Make sure you have it installed to run the application.
   - Download Ollama from the official website: [Ollama Download](https://ollama.com/download).

### How to Run

1. **Run the Pre-Boot Script (`pre-boot-script.py`)**:
   - The pre-boot script will start by verifying that `Ollama` is installed and will then automatically launch the `main.py` script.
   
   To run the pre-boot script, follow these steps:
   
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder containing the `pre-boot-script.py` file.
   - Run the following command:
   
     ```bash
     python pre-boot-script.py
     ```

2. **What Happens Next**:
   - The `pre-boot-script.py` will:
     - Verify if `Ollama` is installed.
     - Start any necessary components for the application.
     - Automatically launch the `main.py` Python script once the environment is ready.

3. **Running the Python Script (`main.py`)**:
   - Once the pre-boot script completes, `main.py` will be launched automatically.
   - No further action is required for running `main.py` as it is handled by the pre-boot script.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error while running `pre-boot-script.py`, make sure that:
  - **Python 3.x** is installed and properly configured.
  - **Ollama** is installed and accessible in your systemâ€™s path.
  
- If the `main.py` script does not run after executing `pre-boot-script.py`, check the console output for any error messages, particularly related to `Ollama` or Python setup.
